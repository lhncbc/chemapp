;;  "Transient gestational and neonatal hypothyroidism-induced
;;  specific changes in androgen receptor expression in skeletal and
;;  cardiac muscles of adult rat."
;;  "The present study aims to identify the association between
;; androgen status and metabolic activity in skeletal and cardiac
;; muscles of adult rats with transient gestational/neonatal-onset
;; hypothyroidism. Pregnant and lactating rats were made hypothyroid
;; by exposing to 0.05% methimazole in drinking water; gestational
;; exposure was from embryonic day 9-14 (group II) or 21 (group III),
;; lactational exposure was from postnatal day 1-14 (group IV) or 29
;; (group V). Serum was collected for hormone assay. Androgen receptor
;; status, Glu-4 expression, and enzyme activities were assessed in
;; the skeletal and cardiac muscles. Serum testosterone and estradiol
;; levels decreased in adult rats of groups II and III, whereas
;; testosterone remained normal but estradiol increased in group IV
;; and V, when compared to coeval control. Androgen receptor ligand
;; binding activi ty increased in both muscle phenotypes with a
;; consistent increase in the expression level of its mRNA and protein
;; expressions except in the forelimb of adult rats with transient
;; hypothyroidism (group II-V). Glut-4 expression remained normal in
;; skeletal and cardiac muscle of experimental rats. Specific activity
;; of hexokinase and lactate dehydrogenase increased in both muscle
;; phenotypes whereas, creatine kinase activity increased in skeletal
;; muscles alone. It is concluded that transient
;; gestational/lactational exposure to methimazole results in
;; hypothyroidism during prepuberal life whereas it increases AR
;; status and glycolytic activity in skeletal and cardiac muscles even
;; at adulthood. Thus, the present study suggests that euthyroid
;; status during prenatal and early postnatal life is essential to
;; have optimal AR status and metabolic activity at adulthood."]
